Added HTML version of Color Coding

Created:
1	CodingColors.html

Reasons:
1	Using html will allow me to format and color the comments on the fly
	and it is not reliant on an office suite.

Deleted:
1	CodingColors.doc

Reasons:
1	I will no longer be using this, will be using the html version instead.
