Modified:
1	noremacDoc/git-noremacDoc
2	^ : usage()
3	^ : version()
4	^ : main()

Reasons:
1	Updated the descriptions on usage and main, they were the same as 
	version. Added dates to the @src attributes.
2	I made it look nicer, seperated out the two commands.
^	Incremented the version.
3	Added a short description of what the extension is supposed to do.
4	Added @error 1-3
