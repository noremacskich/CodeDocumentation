Reasons:
1	Changed the font type.  Also added a var type section, and a style guide
	section.
2	Added 2 new Attributes to a parameter, a T and F.  T standing for true,
	the F standing for the false.  You specify what the true and false means
	on the respective lines.  There is a trailing D that goes after either 
	the T or F, to indicate which one is the default value.
