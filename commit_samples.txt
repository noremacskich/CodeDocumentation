        BeforePush.log
        History.log
        HTMLDebug folder
        
GitStuff folder  - Hold BeforePush.log and History.log.

HTMLDebug folder - Holds the static html that gives the basic appearence of the page.

------------------------


Created:
1	HTMLDebut/UserEndInterface/
2	HTMLDebut/UserEndInterface/inputgui.html

Reasons:
1	Created folder to seperate out the various web interfaces.  Each folder will have the static HTML needed
	to create a page.  Then it will have a php version of that html file that will be called to dynamically
	output the HTML.
2	This will be used for the clients to sign up on.

------------------------

Gotten inputgui.html mostly complete, need to do:
	make it look more attractive
	incorperate canvas for signatures.


------------------------

Created:
1	DisectingThis folder

Reasons:
1	to disect how the canvas works, just need to remove unneeded bits of code.

------------------------

Deleted
1	DisectingThis folder
2		Canvas Paint - Example 5_files folder
3			example5.js
4		CanvasPaint - Example 5.htm

Reasons:
1-4	Found a better example

------------------------

Created
1	HTMLDebug/SignatureTesting Folder

Downloaded:
2	Signature-pad-master.zip

Unzipped:
3	signature-pad-master.zip

Reasons:
1	To try this code that was created for the express purpose of 
	creating signatures on a canvas.
	From demo, it handles the leaving and entering of the canvas
	quite well, without any other bugs that I have noticed from
	other examples.
	
2	The Zip File comes from here:
	https://github.com/thomasjbradley/signature-pad/
	
	And Documentation for use is here:
	http://thomasjbradley.ca/lab/signature-pad/
		
3	Well, I need to test it somehow :P

------------------------

Created:
1	HTMLDebug/SignaturePad/MyTry/ Folder
2	HTMLDebug/SignaturePad/MyTry/SignatureTry.html
3	HTMLDebug/SignaturePad/MyTry/Java/ Folder


Reasons:
1	Collect everything needed to make this work in one spot
2	We need a page to try this on!!
3	This is where we store all the external java files to make this work

------------------------


Now for the fun part, get it working!

------------------------

Created:
1	GitStuff/code chunks.txt

Reasons:
1	This is a place where I can store chunks of code that might be useful in future

------------------------

Moved/Copied:
1	jquery.signaturepad.css
2	jquery.signaturepad.min.js
3	json2.min.js
4	jquery.min.js
5	NEW-BSD-LICENSE.txt

Reasons:
1-4	These are files needed for signature to work.
5	Need it there for legal reasons

Other:
	SignatureTry.html works now, but next I need to figure
	out how to get the information and replicate the signature
	
------------------------
Created/Copied:
1	MyTryExperimental

Renamed:
2	MyTryExperimental/SignatureTry.html

Reasons:
1	This way I will always have a working version.
2	To SignatureTryExp.html - this way I can visually check
	to make sure that I am not modifying the working file

HTMLDebug folder - Holds the static html that gives the basic appearence of the page.
Membership.html - Show all the members of a club and user interface to change the details.

------------------------

Initial thought process for Page
Better to have everything related to one person in a single group, or seperate out
the stuff that will stay on the screen from the scrollable stuff...

------------------------

Got the basic webpage setup with people on it.
Adding Styles Next

------------------------


Created HTMLDebug/Stylesheets folder
        People.css
        
StyleSheets folder - Holds the style sheets for all the html pages in HTMLDebug
People.css - Controls how the rows for each person appears in Membership.html

------------------------

Styling mostly complete, looks like a table with the styling.

column# classes will have to be generated each time to accomadate varying widths of text

do something like below to make table look uniform

        462
 1 2 3 4 | 6 7 8 9 0
 x x x x x x x x x x x x x x 
 x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

	can display the class schedule

4/14/2013 2:13pm------------------------
Created:
1	calendar.svg

Reasons:

	events on an svg than a html document.  Also styling should be easier, and
	creating the svg file on the fly should not be that difficult.
	
2:21pm------------------------

Created:
1	PHPfunctions
2		calendersvg.php

Reasons:
1	This will hold all of our php functions.
2	This will hold all the functions required to create the svg calendar.

	calendar
	
4/16/2013 8:40AM---------------------------

Other:
1	Found php function tester online

Info:
1	http://writecodeonline.com/php/

	goes along the side of the calendar

9:27AM------------------------

Created:
1	Regex : (\d?\d):(\d\d)([A|P])M

Reasons:
1	To get the number of minutes from class.

Other:
	Regex:
		(\d?\d):(\d\d)([A|P])M
	String:
		19:00PM
	Captured groups:
		0: "19:00PM"
		1: "19"
		2: "00"
		3: "P"
		
10:40AM------------------------
Created:
1	Regex

Reasons:
1	This regex will help reduce the size of the Weekdays column, by turning it
	into seven bits.
	
	
Other:
	Regex:
		(Monday)?,? ?(Tuesday)?,? ?(Wednesday)?,? ?(Thursday)?,? ?(Friday)?,? ?(Saturday)?,? ?(Sunday)?,? ?
	String:
		Monday, Wednesday 
	Captured groups:
		0: "Monday, Wednesday "
		1: "Monday"
		2: ""
		3: "Wednesday"
		4: ""
		5: ""
		6: ""
		7: ""
		
11:33AM------------------------
Created:
1	PHPfuncitons\calendarSVG.php : TimeConvert()

Reasons:
1	This will convert the inputed time, into the number of minutes since the 
	start of the day.
	

4/18/2013-----------------------------

Trying to figure out best way to display calendar in general:
	1	Have everything in 1 svg
	2	Have header floating in seperate div, and have the times in div below
		the header
		
Created:
1	layouts/
2	layouts/single.svg
3	layouts/

Reasons:
1	This will hold the second option for trying the layout of the calendar

12:53PM------------------------

Got the week layout working.

4/27/2013 3:09 PM------------------------

Added:
1	jQuery reference

Reasons:
1	To manipulate the calendar a lot easier

3:45 PM------------------------

Tip:
1	When you want to overlap two elements, you need to have the parent element
	be relatively positioned.  Then you need to absolutely position the two 
	elements that you want to overlap.
	
4:17 pm------------------------
Progress:
1	Changed the placement of text in hours, still needs adjustment
2	Moved the hours lines up to 0, instead of 6.5, easier for direct time
	conversion between hours and events
3	Figured out how to place events over the hours grid
4	Got a couple of events on calendar
5	Have Scrollbar automatically scrolling to 8:00 AM

Thoughts:
1	Should be able to easily change the pixel / time ratio, therefore rendering 
	the times should match up.
2	Dynamic changes come later, when I have everything laid out the way I want 
	it
3	Need to come up with design goals, and success criteria

Deleted:
1	PHPfunctions/ohter
2	PHPfunctions/other.js

Reasons:
1	The file wasn't related to this project
2	The file wasn't related to this project

5:14 pm------------------------

Progress:
1	Tweaked a few more things
2	Commented the lines in the event, explaining how to get the attributes

5:59 PM -------------------------

Progress:
1	Found way to control font size
2	Each event will now have 2 lines, 1 for the title of the event, and another 
	for the location of the event.

Copied
1	layouts/2svgdiv.html to layouts/2svgdiv.php

Reasons:
1	This will be modified to create php functions that will output the display.
