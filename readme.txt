Purpose of this Repository:
	Provide a place that I can gather my thoughts on documenting code and commits.

How to use the the Implementation:
	In notepad++ there is a plugin called Automation Scripts.  If you create a new script for that and copy and paste the code from the Notepad++Implementation.cs into it, you should be able to run it on a function header.
	Right now it works in a limited fashion with PHP and C#.
